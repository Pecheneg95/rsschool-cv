# About Me

I am 27 years old, married, I have a daughter. I work in the construction industry as a pre-production engineer. During the time that I spent in this area, I realized that there will not be much growth in it and the stage of stagnation is already beginning. I have always liked everything related to mathematics, physics, algorithms and computers, in this regard, I decided to change my life path and move along the path of a front-end developer. I think my perseverance, determination, sociability and extraordinary mind will help me on this path.
